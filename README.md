# home-lab

This repository provides a setup guide and configurations for building a homelab using Raspberry Pi (RPi) devices. The homelab can be used for learning, testing, and personal projects, leveraging containerized applications and enhancing privacy and cybersecurity.

I have named my three RPi devices after popular South Indian dishes namely `Sundal` `Vadai` `Payasam`
